AboutCode Manager provides an advanced visual UI to help you quickly evaluate
license and other notices identified by [ScanCode] (https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/) and record your conclusion
about the effective license(s) for a component. AboutCode Manager is based on
Electron and will be the primary desktop/GUI tool for using nexBâ€™s AboutCode
tools. This app works on Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems.

The ScanCode toolkit detects licenses, copyrights and other interesting
information in your code. The AboutCode Manager allows you take the scan results
from the ScanCode Toolkit and create components. By creating these components
within in your codebase, you are creating a software inventory of your product.
The conclusions (Concluded License, Concluded Owner, etc.) you make when
creating your component can then be exported to a JSON file.

## Using

* You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-manager/releases) for your operating system or build it yourself (see below).
Once downloaded, you can find `AboutCode-Manager` under `dist/AboutCode-Manager-<os>-x64-<version>`.
* AboutCode Manager v1 is only compatible with scans from [ScanCode Toolkit v2.0.0-RC1] (https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases) and above which are run with the ScanCode -i option.  You need to run ScanCode with the -c (copyright detection) and -l (license detection) options in order to get copyright and license data.  The -p option will detect and report package level metadata if available.

```bash
./scancode -clip <input> <output_file>
```

* We have provided a set of sample scans that you can quickly review in AboutCode Manager in order to get a sense of its functionality and the types of information captured by a scan.  The samples are located at [https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-manager/tree/master/samples] (https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-manager/tree/master/samples).  They currently include the following JSON files:
  * fuse-2.9.1-scan.json
  * protobuf-3.0.0-scan.json
  * rapidjson-1.1.0-scan.json
  * zlib-1.2.11-scan.json

  Download one or more of the samples and open the samples from the File open button in AboutCode Manager.

See the [wiki] (https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-manager/wiki) for more documentation on how to use AboutCode Manager.
