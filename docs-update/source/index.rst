Spreadsheets
------------

-  Our standard format is Excel (``.xlsx``) with Headers and Footers for any customer-facing document.

-  If you use LibreCalc or similar be sure to clear all filters before you save as ``.xlsx``. If you save with filters on, anyone opening in Excel will get Name Conflict errors.

-  We seem to frequently end up with “infinite” columns or rows in a spreadsheet worksheet. The primary technique to clear this is:

   -  Infinite columns

      -  Select the column to the right after the last one you want to keep

      -  Use :kbd:`Control` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`right arrow` to select all columns to the right

      -  Delete selected columns

      -  Save the file

   -  Infinite rows – same sequence except you select first row below the last one you want to keep and use :kbd:`down arrow` instead of :kbd:`right arrow`
