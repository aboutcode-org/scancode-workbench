Open a SQLite File
==================

Once you've imported your JSON scan and saved it as SQLite, in most cases you'll continue your
review and analysis work solely in the SQLite file.

* To open a SQLite File:

  .. figure:: data/open-sqlite-cropped.png
     :class: with-border
     :width: 250px

     ..

     Open a SQLite file.

  * Select the :kbd:`File` menu and then select :kbd:`Open SQLite File` (keyboard shortcut:
    :kbd:`Ctrl+O` or :kbd:`⌘+O`).
  * In the dialog window that opens, navigate to the SQLite file you want to open, select the file
    and click :kbd:`Open`.

Save as a New SQLite File
=========================

There may be times when you need to preserve the current state of your work and continue
working in a separate file.  No problem -- just save your work as a new SQLite file.

* To save as a new SQLite file:

  .. figure:: data/save-as-sqlite-cropped.png
     :class: with-border
     :width: 300px

     ..

     Save as new SQLite file.

  * Select the :kbd:`File` menu and then select :kbd:`Save As New SQLite File` (keyboard shortcut:
    :kbd:`Ctrl+S` or :kbd:`⌘+S`).
  * In the dialog window that opens, add a name for the file, navigate to the directory in which
    you want to save the file and click :kbd:`Save`.
