:guilabel:`[Intro to come.]`

In the table view, the available clues detected by `ScanCode Toolkit <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/>`_
are shown in a tabular format. A user can see provenance clues such as license and copyright
information detected by ScanCode. A user can also see the file information (e.g., file type,
file size, etc) and package information (package type, primary language of package) that was
detected.

The columns can be sorted as well as shown or hidden based on what the userâ€™s
preferences. Searching for specific clues (license names, copyrights, etc.) is also available in
this view.
